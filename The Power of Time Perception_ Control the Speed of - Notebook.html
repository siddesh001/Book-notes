oup A was asked to calculate their hourly wage before the song started, whereas Group B was not asked. The participants in Group A felt less happy, more impatient, and felt that listening to that music was a waste of time. Group B did not. The study showed that most people tend to avoid wasting time so as to maximize the money that they can generate. The additional free time that technology has allowed for is often not spent on enjoying life but rather on working more. And though people may be earning more money, they are not earning more time to spend it in. The higher the paycheck, the scarcer time seems, and the more rushed people become.

In 1868, German physiologist Karl von Vierordt became interested in people’s ability to guess time intervals. He observed that people tend to overestimate short intervals and underestimate long intervals. It implied that there must be an interim period, whose duration people could guess correctly. This is called Vierordt’s Law. Vierordt found that this indifference interval was around three seconds.

, it is not by chance that the three-second interval happens to show up in many areas of our lives. In songs and classical music, musical phrases blend nicely when they are made of musical motifs that are two to three seconds long. The famous musical motif in Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, the one that sounds like fate is knocking on your door, is around three seconds long. The same is true for poetry: the average duration of a spoken verse in most languages corresponds to about three seconds. This seems to be a universal phenomenon.

This is obvious in racing scenes or speeding stagecoaches in Western movies. The illusion occurs because the recording speed at which the movie is filmed, usually 24 frames per second, is slower than the speed at which the wheels are turning. The result is that the video camera captures one distinct snapshot of the rotating wheel at a position that moves slightly behind with every turn. When these positions are replayed in film, the wheel appears to be rotating backwards, giving rise to the illusion

</div>
<div class="noteText">
The brain is too busy focusing to keep track of other things. Nearly all of our brain’s available processing power is devoted to one activity and very little is available to time keeping. As a result, the attention counter gate of our internal clock gets narrow and starts missing the ticks emitted. This causes activity durations to seem shorter and thus time runs faster. “The common element in all ‘flow’ experiences is total absorption, which diverts attention from the passing time causing it to pass swiftly”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Encouraging “Flow”: Motivation, Goals, and Challenges >  Page 84
</div>
<div class="noteText">
People tend to experience flow when there is a set of clear goals with specific rules. Examples of this might be tennis, chess, or poker, because these games have set objectives and rules with intrinsic rewards that put players in a self-contained world. The same happens when someone is playing a musical instrument, performing a religious ritual, or climbing a mountain.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Recap >  Page 87
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Time slows down or speeds up in direct proportion to the degree of attention and mental focus that we devote to its passing. When we are aware of the passing of time, the “experienced duration” expands and time slows down, as is evident from activities that involve an element of anticipation or a heightened awareness of time. When our attention is distracted from tracking time, the experienced duration shrinks and time flies. Due to our limited span of attention, the more difficult or complex the thing you are doing, the more distracted you will be from tracking time and the faster it will go by.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Recap >  Page 88

<div class="noteText">
To slow down time, be mindful and focus on the present moment. To speed up boring situations, avoid time cues or anything that makes you aware of the passing of time. Focus instead on the activity in hand and time will pass more quickly. Living the perfect moment involves a mental state of total absorption, relaxed focus, and gratification. This is referred to as a state of “flow” and it occurs when we are mindfully immersed in an activity to the extent that we become totally oblivious to the passage of time. It might sound contradictory, but to make the most of your time, lose track of it. Activities that produce flow can occur at work, during leisure time, and in almost any situation that involves clear goals, challenges that match skill level, and an immediate reward. Low-motivation passive activities, like watching TV or relaxing on the beach, are necessary sometimes, but do not produce the same satisfaction as high-motivation active and flow-inducing activities. It is now time to look at another very important factor that affects our time perception, which, when taken to extremes, can almost freeze time altogether!
