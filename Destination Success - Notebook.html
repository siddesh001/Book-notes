Experiencing Success through the Senses Next in our adventure to achieve lasting success, we will go through a step-by-step plan to outline the things that are most important to you. We will map out the top ten areas of personal success with laser-like accuracy, and you will begin to see where you are naturally strong and where you may be weak. The good, bad, beautiful, and ugly—you have to see it all if you want a complete life of success. The picture of a successful life is amazing, and everyone who comes by will stop to admire how well the colors and designs come together. Emotions Can you feel it? Can you already sense a place that you have never been to but know in your heart really exists? Can you sense a feeling of peace and security that you have longed to feel? Can you feel the old hurts and resentments fading away, slipping into a place that doesn’t matter anymore? Can you close your eyes and know that your life is good and blessed by God? Can you feel your incredible value and worth? Can you already feel success? Sight Can you see it? Can you envision yourself on the porch of a house that you would feel comfortable calling “home”? Can you see yourself in a healthy body—a strong, fit, rested body? Can you see the smile on the faces of those you love as you hold them close? Can you see yourself crossing off another goal as you continue winning in life? Can you already see success? Touch Can you touch it? Can you reach out and grasp the hand of someone reaching back to you? Can you feel the wet, dense soil between your fingers as you plant a rosebush that will produce flowers for many years? Can you feel the smoothness of the gold in the ring that you have wanted to give to the love of your life? Can you feel the softness of the down comforter as you stretch out for another ten minutes of rest? Can you touch success? Taste Can you taste it? Can you taste your own hot, salty sweat as you finish up a great workout? Can you taste the warmth of hot chocolate with marshmallows by the fire on a cold night? Can you savor the creamy texture of a rich dessert that was so big you had to split it with a friend? Can you taste the piece of fine chocolate left on your pillow at your favorite resort as you slowly let it melt in your mouth? Can you taste success? Hearing Can you hear it? Can you hear the laughter of a child? How about the love and respect of your parents as they tell you how proud they are just to be called your mom and dad? Can you hear the sound of the wind as it fills the sails of the boat you have always wanted to pilot? Can you hear the words whispered into your ears that you have been longing to hear from your marriage partner? Can you hear the praise and applause of your peers as you win yet another award for excellence in your career? Can you already hear the sounds of success?

Joe could have become quite bitter; he had every right to be ticked off at the world. Instead, he modeled the attributes of a success seeker. His lifestyle was motivated by his belief that God was in control. This gave him incredible power to perform at his best, because he knew that God blesses based on personal choice in spite of other people’s manipulation.
