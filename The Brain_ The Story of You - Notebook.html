All the experiences in your life– from single conversations to your broader culture– shape the microscopic details of your brain. Neurally speaking, who you are depends on where you’ve been. Your brain is a relentless shape- shifter, constantly rewriting its own circuitry– and because your experiences are unique, so are the vast, detailed patterns in your neural networks. Because they continue to change your whole life, your identity is a moving target; it never reaches an endpoint.

Many animals are born genetically preprogrammed, or “hardwired” for certain instincts and behaviors. Genes guide the construction of their bodies and brains in specific ways that define what they will be and how they’ll behave. A fly’s reflex to escape in the presence of a passing shadow; a robin’s preprogrammed instinct to fly south in the winter; a bear’s desire to hibernate; a dog’s drive to protect its master: these are all examples of instincts and behaviors that are hardwired. Hardwiring allows these creatures to move as their parents do from birth, and in some cases to eat for themselves and survive independently. In humans the situation is somewhat different. The human brain comes into the world with some amount of genetic hardwiring (for example, for breathing, crying, suckling, caring about faces, and having the ability to learn the details of their native language). But compared to the rest of the animal kingdom, human brains are unusually incomplete at birth. The detailed wiring diagram of the human brain is not preprogrammed; instead, genes give very general directions for the blueprints of neural networks, and world experience fine- tunes the rest of the wiring, allowing it to adapt to the local details. The human brain’s ability to shape itself to the world into which it’s born has allowed our species to take over every ecosystem on the planet and begin our move into the solar system.

The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, important for controlling impulses, is among the most belated regions to mature, not reaching its adult state until the early twenties. Well before neuroscientists worked out the details, car insurance companies noticed the consequences of incomplete brain maturation– and they accordingly charge more for teen drivers. Likewise, the criminal justice system has long held this intuition, and thus juveniles are treated differently than adults.

We think of color as a fundamental quality of the world around us. But in the outside world, color doesn’t actually exist. When electromagnetic radiation hits an object, some of it bounces off and is captured by our eyes. We can distinguish between millions of combinations of wavelengths – but it is only inside our heads that any of this becomes color. Color is an interpretation of wavelengths, one that only exists internally. And it gets stranger, because the wavelengths we’re talking about involve only what we call “visible light”, a spectrum of wavelengths that runs from red to violet. But visible light constitutes only a tiny fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum – less than one ten-trillionth of it. All the rest of the spectrum – including radio waves, microwaves, X-rays, gamma rays, cell phone conversations, wi-fi, and so on – all of this is flowing through us right now, and we’re completely unaware of it

In threatening situations, an area of the brain called the amygdala kicks into high gear, commandeering the resources of the rest of the brain and forcing everything to attend to the situation at hand. When the amygdala is in play, memories are laid down with far more detail and richness than under normal circumstances; a secondary memory system has been activated. After all, that’s what memory is for: keeping track of important events, so that if you’re ever in a similar situation, your brain has more information to try to survive.

Delta waves (below 4 Hz) occur during sleep; Theta waves (4–7 Hz) are associated with sleep, deep relaxation, and visualization; Alpha waves (8–13 Hz) occur when we are relaxed and calm; Beta waves (13–38 Hz) are seen when we are actively thinking and problem solving. Other ranges of brain waves have been identified as important since then, including Gamma waves (39–100 Hz) which are involved in concentrated mental activity, such as reasoning and planning.

Under special circumstances it becomes particularly easy to witness internal conflict between the different parts of the brain. As a treatment for certain forms of epilepsy, some patients undergo “split-brain” surgery, in which the brain’s two hemispheres are disconnected from each other. Normally the two hemispheres are connected by a super-highway of nerves called the corpus callosum, and this allows the right and left halves to coordinate and work in concert.

A cochlear implant bypasses problems in the biology of the ear and feeds its audio signals directly to the undamaged auditory nerve, the brain’s data cable for sending electrical impulses on to the auditory cortex for decoding. The implant picks up sounds from the outside world and passes them to the auditory nerve by means of sixteen tiny electrodes. The experience of hearing doesn’t arrive immediately: people have to learn to interpret the foreign dialect of the signals fed to the brain. As one cochlear implant recipient, Michael Chorost, describes his experience: “When the device was turned on a month after surgery, the first sentence I heard sounded like ‘Zzzzzz szz szvizzz ur brfzzzzzz?’ My brain gradually learned how to interpret the alien signal. Before long, ‘Zzzzzz szz szvizzz ur brfzzzzzz?’ became ‘What did you have for breakfast?’

Alien Hand Syndrome A disorder resulting from a treatment for epilepsy known as a corpus callosotomy, in which the corpus callosum is cut, disconnecting the two cerebral hemispheres of the brain, also known as split-brain surgery. This disorder causes unilateral and sometimes intricate hand movements without the patient feeling they have volitional control of the movements. Axon The anatomical output projection of a neuron capable of conducting electrical signals from the cell body. Cerebrum Human brain areas including the large, undulate exterior cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory bulb. Development of this area in higher order mammals contributes to more advanced cognition and behavior. Cerebellum A smaller anatomical structure that sits below the cerebral cortex at the rear of the head. This area of the brain is essential for fluid motor control, balance, posture, and possibly some cognitive functions. Computational Hypothesis of Brain Function A framework proposing that the interactions in the brain are implementing computations, and that the same computations, if run on a different substrate, would equally give rise to the mind. Connectome A three-dimensional map of all neuronal connections in the brain. Corpus Callosum A strip of nerve fibers located in the longitudinal fissure between the two cerebral hemispheres that enables communication between them. Dendrites The anatomical input projections of a neuron that carry electrical signals initiated by neurotransmitter release from other neurons to the cell body. Dopamine A neurotransmitter in the brain linked to motor control, addiction, and reward. Electroencephalography (EEG) A technique used to measure electrical activity at millisecond resolution in the brain by connecting conductive electrodes to the scalp. Each electrode captures the summation of millions of neurons underlying the electrode. This method is used to capture fast changes in brain activity in the cortex. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) A neuroimaging technique that detects brain activity with second resolution by measuring blood flow in the brain with millimeter resolution. Galvanic Skin Response A technique that measures changes in the autonomic nervous system which occur when someone experiences something new, stressful, or intense even if below conscious awareness. In practice, a machine is hooked up to the fingertip and the electrical properties of the skin are monitored that change along with activity in the skin sweat glands. Glial Cell Specialized cells in the brain that protect neurons by providing nutrients and oxygen to them, removing waste, and generally supporting them. Neural Of or relating to the nervous system or neurons. Neuron A specialized cell found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, including brain, spinal cord, and sensory cells, that communicates to other cells using electrochemical signals. Neurotransmitter Chemicals that are released from one neuron to another recipient neuron, usually across a synapse. These are found in the central and peripheral nervous systems including the brain, spinal cord, and sensory neurons throughout the body. Neurons may release more than one neurotransmitter. Parkinson’s Disease A progressive disorder characterized by movement difficulties and tremors that is caused by the deterioration of dopamine-producing cells in a midbrain structure called the substantia nigra. Plasticity The brain’s ability to adapt by creating new or modifying existing neural connections. The capability of the brain to exhibit plasticity is important after an injury in order to compensate for any acquired deficits. Sensory Substitution An approach to compensate for an impaired sense in which sensory information is fed into the brain through unusual sensory channels. For example, visual information is converted into vibrations on the tongue or auditory information is converted into patterns of vibrations on the torso, allowing an individual to see or hear respectively. Sensory Transduction Signals from the environment, such as photons (sight), air compression waves (hearing) or scent molecules (smell) are converted (transduced) into action potentials by specialized cells. It is the first step by which information from outside the body is received by the brain. Split-brain Surgery Also known as a corpus callosotomy, the corpus callosum is severed as a measure to control epilepsy not cured by other means. This surgery removes the communication between the two cerebral hemispheres. Synapse The space typically between an axon of one neuron and a dendrite of another neuron where communication between neurons occurs by release of neurotransmitters. Axon–axon and dendrite–dendrite synapses also exist. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) A non-invasive technique used to stimulate or inhibit brain activity using a magnetic pulse to induce small electric currents in underlying neural tissue. This technique is typically used to understand the influence of brain areas in neural circuits. Ulysses Contract An unbreakable contract used to bind oneself to a potential future goal made when one understands one may not have the ability to make a rational choice at that time. Ventral Tegmental Area A structure comprised of mostly dopaminergic neurons located in the midbrain. This area plays a critical role in the reward system.
