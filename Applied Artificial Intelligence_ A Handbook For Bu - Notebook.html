CTO Chief Technology Officers create technology for an enterprise’s external business or individual customers. The CTO defines the technology architecture, runs engineering teams, and continuously improves the technology behind the company’s product offerings. Creativity, technical skill, and ability to innovate are essential to a CTO’s success.

CAO Along with the CDO, the Chief Analytics Officer (CAO) is a relatively new role that has emerged to manage enterprise investment in big data and analytics. Companies that are early in the maturity cycle for big data may still be working to integrate, clean, organize, prepare, and transform data into an institutional asset. Once a CDO or comparable leader has organized high-quality data, a CAO can then apply meaningful analytics to solve business problems. The roles overlap, and the titles are often interchangeable.

Data Science Team Manager A data science team manager understands how best to deploy the expertise of his team in order to maximize their productivity on a project. This manager should have sufficient technical knowledge to understand what his team members are doing and how best to support them; at the same time, this manager must also have good communications skills in order to liaise with the leadership or non-technical units. Though a person originally hired for a more junior role might organically fill this leadership position, teams that do not have designated and experienced managers are generally less productive. Machine Learning (ML) Engineers As their title indicates, ML engineers build machine learning solutions to solve business and customer problems. These specialized engineers deploy models, manage infrastructure, and run operations related to machine learning projects. They are assisted by data scientists and data engineers to manage databases and build the data infrastructure necessary to support the products and services used by their customers. Data Scientists Data scientists typically work in an offline setting and do not deal directly with the production experience, which is what the end user would see. Data scientists collect data, spend most of their time cleaning it, and the rest of their time looking for patterns in the data and building predictive models. They often have degrees in statistics, data science, or a related discipline. Alternately, many have programming backgrounds and hold degrees in computer science, math, or physics. Researchers, Research Scientists Researchers are more focused on driving scientific discovery and less concerned with pursuing industrial applications of their findings. They often build on promising leads uncovered by data scientists and experiment with novel approaches, much of which originates from or is inspired by work done in academic or industry research facilities. Applied Research Scientists, Applied Research Engineers Applied researchers straddle research and engineering. Unlike pure researchers, they are more concerned with practical research, such as identifying and implementing workable solutions to a specific problem or formulating industrial applications for scientific discoveries. Data Engineers, Distributed Systems Engineers Given the vast amounts of data and computation power required, most ML models face scalability issues. A talented infrastructure engineer can resolve challenges associated with large datasets, allowing researchers and data scientists to focus on their models rather than on data issues. Though this role is not explicitly focused on machine learning, it’s a vital component of a complete ML team.

The skills required for successful careers in machine learning are different from those in traditional software development. Software development often has clearly structured tasks with well-defined deadlines for delivery and release. Once a key feature is done, engineers typically disengage and move on to another development project. While bug fixes and operational maintenance are required after completion, successful software development projects start with relatively clear specifications and product design and are launched when they meet release requirements. By contrast, machine learning is highly exploratory and experimental, with less clear timelines and success metrics. Ideal performance targets may not be knowable in advance and may shift during a project. Algorithms require ongoing support, training, and feedback in order to perform optimally.

WOT Analysis SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. This popular business framework can also be used to evaluate AI opportunities. Use this approach to uncover opportunities as well as potential weaknesses that you need to mitigate. You can apply the analysis to your own company as well as to competitors. In a SWOT analysis, first evaluate the internal factors affecting your business. What are your strengths? What makes the department so great? Which projects or teams are finding success? Next consider your business’s weaknesses. Which projects or departments are unprofitable? What resources do you lack? What can be done better? The second half of a SWOT analysis considers the external factors, such as opportunities and threats, in the marketplace. What are your business goals? How can new technologies such as AI drive your enterprise forward? Are there new audiences that you should target? Finally, list any threats that may derail your company, department, or project. What obstacles do you face? Who is your primary competitor? Can you do anything to prevent or minimize potential threats?

These tech companies often know more than you do about what your customers search for, what they buy, what they say, who they interact with, where they are, and how they might behave in the future.

Even perfectly-implemented algorithms will fail without the right data. This is no different from a human expert arriving at the wrong conclusions after being given the wrong facts. Many theoretical AI examples assume that you possess enough of the right kind of data, but in the real world, data is often irrelevant, incomplete, or messy.
